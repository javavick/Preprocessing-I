        know by signing up on this website.

          As a mobile suit pilot, Char excels in land, air, and space combat. He
          will exploit the disadvantages of his foe and use it to his advantage.
          Char is also able to bring out the full potential of a mobile suit,
          and is able to hold his ground against the technologically superior
          RX-78-2 Gundam with commander versions of the Zaku, Z'Gok, and
          Gelgoog. His days at the Zeon Space Defense Military Academy helped
          him hone his combat skills as a foot soldier, such as using firearms,
          detonating explosives, and fencing. His bold leadershi, which he is
          well known for, was also developed at the military academy. Char's
          Newtype abilities developed as a result of long term training. Char is
          also a cunning strategist and tactician, managing to outsmart many of
          his enemies, even when he is not piloting a mobile suit. Char, like
          his father, seems to be a natural born orator.
